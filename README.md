## CS6400 Database Systems Concepts and Design Project

This project is to build a web application which can update inventory, track sales, maintain repair history, and let customers and users search inventory and generate reports.
- Inventory clerks, who add vehicles to inventory
- Salespeople, who will only have access to searching available inventory, and entering sales transactions
- Service writers, who enter repair details
- Managers, who can view inventory, sales transactions, repair history, and reports
- And the owner who has access to everything and can perform any activity in the system (a combination of all permissions)
We stored all data in a relational database, and implemented the database schemas using MySQL, then connect the MySQL database to PHP using phpMyAdmin.
